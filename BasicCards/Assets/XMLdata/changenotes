-XML scripts into sub folder of xmlscripts. Organization
-script DraggableGrid, moved to z_old for scripts. Purpose was to drag similar to draggable script, but would jump from place to place and only move along a grid. Was part of the solution for the targeting grid, changed because grids lining up was impratical
-Prefab called WeaponSquare, moved into /old prefab folder. Unsure of purpose, think it was something to do with the alternate version of the TargetSquare prefab
